# Class diary  
#
# Create program for handling lesson scores.
# Use python to handle student (highscool) class scores, and attendance.
# Make it possible to:
# - Get students total average score (average across classes)
# - get students average score in class
# - hold students name and surname
# - Count total attendance of student
# The default interface for interaction should be python interpreter.
# Please, use your imagination and create more functionalities. 
# Your project should be able to handle entire school.
# If you have enough courage and time, try storing (reading/writing) 
# data in text files (YAML, JSON).
# If you have even more courage, try implementing user interface.
